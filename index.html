            My basketball journey started in 2021, but in a very unexpected way. Despite living in Massachusetts, surrounded by Celtics fans, 
            I found myself drawn to the Washington Wizards of all teams. The reason? Russell Westbrook. One of my friends was a huge fan of 
            Westbrook, and through watching him play, I slowly started enjoying basketball myself.

            At first, I was just watching a player, but soon, I became immersed in the NBA’s social media world—seeing what the media was saying, 
            following community discussions, and laughing at the wild agendas being pushed. The next season, Westbrook moved to the Lakers, where 
            he played horribly and was labeled as "washed." It was hard to watch but also funny to see the insane narratives people created.

            Now, I watch the NBA a lot and even started playing basketball myself. Over time, I got good at it and developed a real love for the sport. 
            Since turning 21, I also do some sports betting here and there to make games more exciting. I have many hobbies, but basketball has easily 
            become my biggest passion.
