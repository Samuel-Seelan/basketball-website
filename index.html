            My basketball journey started in 2021, but in a very unexpected and unpredictable way. Despite living in Massachusetts, surrounded by passionate Celtics fans, I found myself strangely drawn to the Washington Wizards of all teams. The reason? Russell Westbrook. One of my closest friends was a huge, dedicated fan of Westbrook, and through watching him play, I slowly started enjoying and appreciating basketball myself.

            At first, I was just casually watching a single player, but soon, I became fully immersed in the NBA’s chaotic social media world—seeing what the media was constantly saying, following heated community discussions, and laughing at the wild, absurd agendas being pushed daily. The next season, Westbrook moved to the Lakers, where he played horribly, struggled significantly, and was labeled as "washed." It was hard to watch but also undeniably funny to see the insane narratives people quickly created.

            Now, I watch the NBA a lot more and even started actively playing basketball myself. Over time, I got really good at it and developed a deep, real love for the sport. Since turning 21, I also do some occasional sports betting here and there to make games much more exciting. I have many different hobbies, but basketball has easily become my biggest and most consuming passion.
